Description

This is a Python project of a ToDo List application. Here I used Flask framework, Bootstrap and a little of JS.
To use this app you will need to register in the application and to use the email:password to log in. Inside you will be able to create some notes and in future you will be able to delete them. Each user have access only to the notes that were added in their account and there is no way to access some other's notes.


Built With:
- Python (Flask)
- HTML
- Bootstrap
- Javascript


Set up this projecect locally:

- Open the terminal in the directory where you want to install the app;
- Run command git clone https://github.com/psergicv/ToDo-List-App.git which will clone the project;
- Open & run app.py in you IDE.
